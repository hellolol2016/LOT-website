                There are a TON of nonprofits committed to a similar mission as
                us, so the inevitable question comes up: what makes us

                We only approve of and execute projects that strongly appeal to
                our youth community. For example, one of our consistent projects
                is a monthly mental podcast, in which our hosts are dedicated to
                the betterment of mental health in our society.
