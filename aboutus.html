            <h2 class='miniheader'>Our vision</h2>
            <p>As our name suggested, we envision a world where 
                everyone can showcase the best of themselves, and 
                our community can truly “laugh out together”.
                <br><br>
                Today, we live in an age where incentive and 
                peer-pressure dominates our passion. In the midst 
                of stereotypes and prejudice, the society seems to 
                be setting a definition for what is useful and who 
                can be useful. With a set definition, many around 
                the community are left behind.
                <br><br>
                Laugh Out Together foundation is here to change 
                this definition. We believe that everyone, no 
                matter their age and status, has an unique passion 
                that can impact the community. Through unconventional 
                volunteer projects, we hope to create a platform that
                 showcases the unique skills and talents of our 
                 community. With the platform we create, we also hope
                  to raise resources to empower individuals in 
                 combating their physical and mental challenges.
                <br><br>
                A little from you, a lot for the world! 
                Together, we will make a difference.

            <p>We are here to prove that our age and status 
                will not limit our eagerness to unify the 
                community. Often, students provide refreshing 
                views and unique opportunities for an issue. 
                Through a student-based leadership, we strive to 
                connect passionate students with those in need of 
                their help and showcase the talents of the youth 
                community through team-based projects.
