                        Here at Laugh Out Together Foundation, we believe every member of our community is unique in their own way, and 
                        we strive to bring out the best of our community. As our name suggests, we envision a world where everyone can

                            We're a foundation based around Orange County and completely run by students. We're currently working around 
                            Irvine in multiple high schools such as Beckman, Woodbridge, Northwood, and University. We are here to prove 
                            that our age and status will not limit our eagerness to unify the community. Often, students provide refreshing 
                            views and unique opportunities for an issue. Through a student-led leadership, we strive to connect passionate 
                            students with those in need of their help and showcase the talents of the youth community through team-based 
                            projects.

                            At the LOT foundation our projects follow a five 
                            step process that is vital to our success. We first 
                            find a problem which we pinpoint right off the bat. 
                            This issue could be a problem that may make a difference
                            in society or lending a helping hand. Our next step is 
                            to connect with organizations dealing with issues. 
                            For example, our first project was directed towards CHOC 
                            because we believed that hospitals are most deserving of 
                            funds for all their efforts during COVID-19. 
                            
                            After brainstorming and pinpointing a problem to deal with and 
                            partnering up with an organization, we come up with a project that will 
                            involve members of the LOT foundation. This will employ their 
                            skills such as graphic design or coding, which are a few of 
                            the many expertises that are utilized in the project. Step four 
                            of the process is to raise money for the organization that is 
                            raising awareness and working hard to solve the issue. The funds 
                            either go directly towards the organization we wished to help or 
                            goes into future events. This five step process is the core of our 
                            team-based activities, and will be the guideline for a majority of 
                            the things we do here at LOT.

                        <p>As our name suggested, we envision a world where 
                            everyone can showcase the best of themselves, and 
                            our community can truly “laugh out together”.
                            Today, we live in an age where incentive and 
                            peer-pressure dominates our passion. In the midst 
                            of stereotypes and prejudice, the society seems to 
                            be setting a definition for what is useful and who 
                            can be useful. With a set definition, many around 
                            the community are left behind.

                            Laugh Out Together foundation is here to change 
                            this definition. We believe that everyone, no 
                            matter their age and status, has an unique passion 
                            that can impact the community. Through unconventional 
                            volunteer projects, we hope to create a platform that
                            showcases the unique skills and talents of our 
                            community. With the platform we create, we also hope
                            to raise resources to empower individuals in 
                            combating their physical and mental challenges.
